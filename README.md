1.0 Introduction
1.1 Overview of   Thermal Management   Systems
Efficient thermal management is crucial for maintaining the performance and
reliability   of   modern   electronic   devices, high-performance   computing   systems, and   aerospace technologies. Vapor chambers, as advanced thermal systems, have gained   significant attention   for their exceptional heat spreading and dissipation capabilities. Recent   studies have
highlighted the increasing demand for efficient thermal management   in data   centres,
aerospace applications, and mobile devices (Weibel  Garimella,   2021;   Hanlon      Ma,   2021;   Davis  Garimella, 2022; Hwang et al., 2021). For   instance,   Hanlon   and   Ma   (2021)
demonstrated the effectiveness of   capillary-driven evaporation in enhancing the thermal
efficiency of   vapor chambers in compact   electronic devices.   Similarly, Zhao   and   Chen   (2023)   investigated   the   role   of   micro   grooved   wick   structures   in   improving   heat   dissipation
performance in high-power density applications. Furthermore, Ju et   al.   (2023)   analysed the   integration of   vapor chambers in lateral artery structures   for enhanced   thermal   control   in
aerospace systems. These findings underscore the growing importance of   vapor chambers   in addressing thermal management challenges across diverse fields.
1.2 Introduction to Vapor Chambers
Vapor chambers are flat, two-phase heat transfer devices designed   for   efficient heat   dissipation. They leverage the principles of   phase change, utilizing a working fluid that
evaporates and condenses within a sealed enclosure to transfer heat   across   large   surfaces   uniformly. Recent advancements in vapor chamber technology have shown improved
performance under extreme thermal conditions (Li et al., 2022).
1.3 Objectives of   the   Study
1.Evaluate the thermal performance of   vapor chambers under varying operational   conditions.
2.Identify key design parameters influencing vapor chamber efficiency.   3.Explore emerging applications and technological advancements.
1.4   Scope and Limitations
This study focuses on analysing vapor chamber performance metrics, including
thermal resistance, heat spreading efficiency, and temperature gradients, while highlighting   design considerations such as material selection, wick structures,   and   fluid properties.
2.0 Fundamentals of   Vapor Chamber Technology
2.1 Working Principle of   Vapor Chambers
The working fluid evaporates at the heat source, travels as vapor   to   the   cooler   region,   condenses, and returns via capillary action through a wick structure. This   cyclical phase
change   ensures   efficient   heat   transport. Recent   research   emphasizes   the   importance   of
selecting appropriate working fluids to optimize thermal conductivity and phase   change
efficiency (Hwang et al., 2021; Ju et   al., 2023).   For   example,   Hwang   et   al.   (2021)
demonstrated that advanced liquid feeding structures improve vapor transport   efficiency,
reducing dry-out conditions and enhancing performance stability. Ju   et   al.   (2023) highlighted the role of   lateral artery designs in improving liquid return through   sintered powder wicks,
optimizing heat dissipation in high-power density applications.
Furthermore, wick structures play a critical role in maintaining capillary pressure   and
ensuring effective fluid transport across the vapor chamber (Cai      Chen, 2023).   Cai   and   Chen (2023) showed that thin-film evaporation from nanostructured wicks   significantly      enhances heat transfer efficiency.   Additionally, Zhao and Chen (2023) observed that
microgroove wick structures increase capillary pumping power, preventing dry-out and   improving reliability under variable heat loads. These findings underscore the interplay   between working fluid properties and wick design in achieving optimal vapor   chamber   performance.
2.2 Phase Change Heat Transfer
Phase change is central to vapor chamber functionality, enabling   high   heat   transfer   efficiency with minimal temperature gradient. Recent research emphasizes the role of
optimized wick designs and nanostructured surfaces in improving phase change   efficiency   (Weibel  Garimella, 2022; Hwang et al., 2021;   Cai      Bhunia,   2022).
2.3 Comparison with Other Thermal Management   Systems
1.Heat Pipes: Vapor chambers offer superior heat spreading due to   their   flat   geometry.
2. Heat   Sinks: Vapor chambers outperform. traditional heat sinks in terms of   localizedheat dissipation. Recent studies have provided direct performance comparisons, showing   vapor chambers' advantages in managing hotspots and uniform. temperature distribution         (Zhao  Chen, 2023;   Li   et   al.,   2022).
2.4 Factors Influencing Vapor Chamber Performance
Several key factors influence the performance of   vapor chambers, and recent research has provided in-depth insights into each aspect:
1. Wick Structure Morphology and Porosity: The design and porosity of   the   wick structure   significantly    affect    the      capillary      action      and      fluid      return      efficiency.      Zhao      et      al.      (2023)   demonstrated   that   microgroove   wick   structures   enhance   capillary   pumping   power,   reducing   dry-out   risks   under   high   heat   flux   conditions.   Similarly,   Cai   and   Chen   (2023)   analysed   thin-   film   evaporation   behaviour   in   nanostructured   wicks,   revealing   improved   thermal   efficiency   under steady-state conditions.
2. Material Thermal Conductivity: The thermal conductivity of   the chamber material
directly affects heat spreading performance. Hanlon et al. (2023)   studied   copper   and   graphene   composite materials, showing a 20% improvement in heat dissipation   compared   to traditional      aluminium designs.
3. Working Fluid Properties: Optimal selection of   the working fluid is   essential   for      maximizing phase change efficiency and maintaining operational stability. Hwang   et   al.
(2021) explored the impact of   nanofluids as working fluids, demonstrating   enhanced thermal conductivity and improved boiling efficiency in vapor chambers.
4. Geometric Configuration: The shape and size   of   the vapor   chamber   influence heat
input distribution and overall performance. Ju   et al.   (2023)   studied lateral   artery   wick   designs,   revealing their effectiveness in reducing thermal gradients across high-power density zones.
These findings highlight the interplay between structural, material, and fluid
properties in optimizing vapor chamber performance, emphasizing the need for integrated   design approaches supported by empirical data   from recent   studies.
3.0 Design Considerations
3.1 Geometric Design and Material   Selection
Geometric design and material selection are fundamental factors   affecting   vapor
chamber efficiency.   Studies have shown that the material's thermal conductivity, such   as
copper and graphene composites, significantly impacts heat dissipation   performance   (Hanlon   et al., 2023). Geometrically optimized designs, including thinner profiles and uniform. wick            structures, contribute to minimizing thermal resistance (Ju et al., 2023).
3.1.1   Selection of Shell Material
The shell of   the vapor chamber is designed using copper   alloy   C5191, known   for   its   excellent thermal conductivity and mechanical strength. The key properties of   this material include a density of   8.84   ⋅   103   kg⁄m3    , a thermal conductivity of   67   W⁄(m   ⋅   K)   ,   and   a yield strength of   450–550 MPa. This material ensures efficient heat transfer under extreme conditions while maintaining mechanical stability under high-pressure differentials. 
3.1.2 Optimization of Shell Thickness
The shell thickness was optimized to maintain stiffness   and minimize   deformation      under   high-pressure   conditions. The   maximum   deformation   of   the   shell   is   calculated   using the formula:

Where:
•             q is the applied pressure (Pa),
•             a is the boundary length   (m),
•            E is the elastic modulus   (Pa),
•            h   is   the   shell   thickness   (m).
For an internal pressure of 1 MPa and a boundary length   of   0.01 m,   the   deformation   is
controlled within   10   μm, ensuring that the vapor chamber's overall performance remains   unaffected.
3.2 Working Fluid and Capillary Wick Structure
The   properties   of   the   working   fluid   and   the   design   of   capillary   wick   structures   play   a critical role in determining vapor chamber performance. Research indicates that nanofluids         and hybrid fluids exhibit higher thermal conductivity and phase change efficiency   compared   to conventional fluids (Hwang et al.,   2021; Wong   et   al.,   2022).
3.3 Heat Input Distribution and Heat   Spreading
In this case, the heat dissipation area almost entirely   covers the heat   source, resulting   in an HSR of   approximately   1. This reflects the heat dissipation characteristics of   vapor
chambers commonly utilized in electronic devices.   Additionally, fins are   incorporated   in this   case to assist in heat dissipation. Due to the complexity of   calculations   and the   difficulty   of       conducting experiments, only the simplified model's key parameters are calculated.
3.4 Effect of   Orientation and   Gravity
Direction and gravity play an important role in the heat transfer process of   the Vapor
Chamber because they affect the flow pattern of   vapor and liquid refrigerants in   the   chamber,   the phase change efficiency, and the overall thermal resistance.
The orientation of   vapor chambers also affects fluid return   and   overall   efficiency.
In a vapor chamber, vapor generated in the evaporation region diffuses   toward   the
condensation region, forming a high-temperature vapor zone. Gravity can impact   the vapor         flow path: In a gravity-assisted mode (evaporation region at the bottom, condensation region   on top), vapor flow only needs to overcome the internal pressure gradient, resulting   in   lower   flow resistance. While in a reverse gravity mode (condensation region at the bottom,
evaporation region on top), vapor must work against gravity, increasing flow resistance and   potentially elevating the equivalent thermal resistance.
And there is importance of   gravity for liquid return.   After condensation, the   liquid must return to the evaporation region. This process depends on capillary forces,   gravity,   or   a
combination   of   both:
In a gravity-assisted mode, liquid flows back to the evaporation region   along the
direction of   gravity, reducing dependence on capillary structures   (e.g., wicks)   and lowering
overall thermal resistance. In a reverse gravity mode, liquid must rely entirely   on   capillary
forces to overcome gravity, placing higher demands on wick   design and potentially   leading to   insufficient liquid supply, reducing the vapor chamber's heat transfer performance
In conclusion, gravity has a significant impact on   liquid return,   with   gravity-assisted   modes offering higher heat transfer efficiency, while reverse gravity or horizontal modes      increase reliance on capillary structures.
Directional effects influence vapor flow and liquid distribution,   indirectly   altering evaporation and condensation efficiency.
Optimized designs such as enhanced wick structures   can mitigate the   impact   of   gravity   and orientation on vapor chamber performance, enabling stable operation   across various orientations.
Research shows that optimized wick structures can mitigate gravitational   effects,
ensuring consistent performance in varying orientations (Ju et al.,   2022).
4.0 Heat Transfer Mechanisms   in Vapor Chambers
4.1 Evaporation and Condensation Process
Evaporation and condensation are the primary mechanisms governing heat transfer in   vapor chambers. During evaporation, heat applied to the vapor chamber surface   causes   the working fluid to absorb energy and transition into vapor. This vapor   then   travels   to the condenser region, where it releases heat and transitions back into liquid form. Recent   studies   by Cai and Chen (2023) demonstrate that optimizing   the   evaporation   interface   through nanostructured wick surfaces significantly enhances heat transfer efficiency. 
4.2 Capillary   Action and Wick Functionality
Capillary action within the wick structure ensures the return of   condensed fluid to   the evaporation zone. The effectiveness of   this process is highly dependent on wick morphology,   porosity, and permeability (Zhao  Chen, 2023).   Advanced designs, including   microgrooves   and nanoporous wicks, have been shown to reduce fluid resistance and improve thermal performance   (Hwang   et   al.,   2021).
4.3 Temperature Distribution and   Steady-State Conditions
Uniform. temperature distribution is essential for minimizing thermal stresses   and
ensuring the reliability of   vapor chambers in high-heat flux environments. Recent   findings indicate that optimized wick designs and advanced material selections   contribute to   achieving   steady-state temperature profiles across the vapor chamber surface (Weibel    Garimella, 2022).
5.0 Performance   Analysis
5.1 Thermal Resistance and Conductivity
Thermal resistance is a critical performance parameter in vapor chambers, directly
affecting their ability to dissipate heat efficiently.   Advanced materials, such as   graphene-
enhanced composites, have demonstrated reduced thermal resistance and increased thermal   conductivity (Hanlon et al.,   2023).
5.1.1   Selection of   Working Fluid
Distilled water was chosen as the working fluid due to its high   latent heat   of
vaporization (2257 kJ/kg) and low viscosity,   which enhance heat transfer efficiency. The   mass flow rate of   the working fluid is   calculated   as:

Where:
Q is the heat   input   (W),
Hfg         is   the   latent   heat   of   vaporization   (J/kg).
5.1.2 Design and Optimization of   Wick
The   wick   structure   is   composed   of   multiple   layers   of   sintered   mesh   with   a   total
optimized thickness of   0.24 mm (each layer bei代 写KQK7003 THERMAL SYSTEMS ENGINEERING SESSION 2024/2025 SEMESTER 1Python
代做程序编程语言ng 0.08 mm).   After oxidation treatment, the       wick surface roughness increased significantly, and the contact   angle   decreased to below   5°   .   The capillary pressure is calculated as:

Where:
σ=0.072   N/m is the surface tension of   distilled water,
θ=5ois the contact   angle,
reff         =0.1   mm   is   the   effective   pore   radius.
The calculated capillary pressure is   1.44 kP, providing sufficient driving force   for   liquid flow. The permeability of   the wick is given by:

Where:
•            ϵ=0.6 is the porosity,
•            τ=2.5 is   the   tortuosity   factor.
The calculated permeability is 2.88X10−12 m2   , ensuring smooth liquid return   flow.   5.1.3 Heat Input Distribution and Heat   Spreading
Uniform. heat input distribution is essential for effective vapor   chamber   operation.         Optimized wick structures and improved fluid distribution mechanisms have demonstrated   significant improvements in heat spreading efficiency (Li et   al.,   2022).
To more intuitively demonstrate the efficient heat transfer performance of   VC, the   following case is   assumed:
An electronic device operates at a stable   temperature   of   75°C.   To   optimize   its   heat
dissipation, a   VC   is   attached   to   itstop   surface, with   fins   placed   on   top   of   the   VC.   A   fan   blows air at 25°C parallel to the passages between the fins. The VC dimensions are   100 mm   ×   15 mm with a thickness of   0.27 mm. Each fin measures   15 mm   ×   30 mm   × 2.5   mm,   with   a   spacing of   5 mm between fins.

5.1.4 Heat Resistance   Calculation
The   total   thermal   resistance   Rtotal         during   the   operation   of   the   vapor   chamber   consists of   the   following   components:
1. Thermal Resistance of   the Evaporation   Section    Rce :

where   δc         is   the   thickness   of   the   chamber   wall, kc   is   the   thermal   conductivity   of   the chamber material, and   Ae is the area of   the evaporation   section.
2. Thermal Resistance of   the Condensation   Section    Rce : This follows the same formula as   Rce   , reflecting   the   thermal   performance   of   the   condensation   area.
3. Thermal   Resistance   in   the   Lengthwise   Direction      Racross   :

where   Leff         is   the   effective   heat   transfer   length   and   Acorss         is   the   cross-sectional   area of   the   chamber   wall.
4. Total   Thermal   Resistance   of   the   Wick   Rwtotal   :

Where   nw         and   kw   represent   the   number   of   wick   channels   and   the   thermal
conductivity of   the wick, respectively, and   Aw is the total cross-sectional area   of   the wick.
5. Total   Thermal   Resistance   of   the   Vapor   Chamber      Rvtotal   :

where P is the vapor pressure,   Rgas       is the gas constant,    nv       and    wc       represent the   number   and   width   of   the   vapor   channels   and      ℎc         is   the   height   of   the   vapor   channel.
The   total   thermal   resistance   Rtotal         is   calculated   as:

5.1.5Thermal Conductivity Calculation
The   effective   thermal   conductivity      keff         of   the   vapor   chamber, a   critical   measure   of its heat transfer capability, is calculated   as:

where   AUTV is the total cross-sectional area for heat transfer.   Substituting the design   and   experimental   parameters   of   the   gas-liquid   coplanar   ultrathin   vapor   chamber   into   the
equations,the   following   results   are   obtained   at   an   operating   temperature   of   55°C:
total thermal resistance R: 0.930 ℃/W
Effective   thermal   conductivity   keff         =   16805 W/(m·K)   For the   fins
The temperature   T0      =   75   C    Ts       =   25   C
According to the table-A15, we get    pr       =0.7228, k=0.2735W/(m*k),   θ   =   1.798   ×   10−5m2   /s
5.2 Heat   Spreading RatioThe Heat   Spreading Ratio (HSR) quantifies the ability of   a   heat dissipation   device,   such   as a vapor chamber, to spread heat from a   small heat   source   area   to   a   larger   heat   dissipation      area. It is defined as the ratio of   the dissipation   area to the   source   area.
For the physical significance of   HSR: Low HSR indicates the heat source   and   dissipation areas are similar in size, making heat spreading relatively   easy.   While high   HSR   indicates   the heat source area is much smaller than the dissipation   area, requiring   efficient   thermal   spreading to minimize temperature differences. 
The Heat   Spreading Ratio is crucial in VC design because it   directly   affects temperature   Gradient: as a higher HSR demands better thermal spreading to avoid   excessive temperature   differences. And Uniformity: Higher HSR makes achieving a uniform. temperature
distribution more challenging. Also affects heat transfer efficiency: Optimizing HSR   improves the overall heat dissipation performance.
This case is a Low HSR (HSR < 2), we need suitable for small-scale devices where heat spreading is less challenging to ensure high heat transfer efficiency. (Cai  Chen, 2023).
5.3 Temperature Gradient   Analysis
Minimizing temperature gradients across the vapor chamber surface is   essential   for
ensuring stable thermal performance. Research indicates that nanostructured   wick designs reduce localized hotspots and achieve consistent temperature profiles (Weibel    Garimella,   2022).
5.4 Comparison with Other Heat Dissipation Methods
5.4.1 Heat Pipes
Vapor chambers outperform. heat pipes in applications requiring flat geometries   and   uniform. heat distribution (Hwang et al.,   2021).
5.4.2 Traditional Heat   Sinks
Traditional heat sinks are less efficient in high heat   flux   scenarios   compared to   vapor   chambers, which exhibit superior performance in temperature uniformity and dissipation
(Zhao    Chen, 2023).
5.5 Factors   Affecting Thermal Performance
Several factors, including material selection, wick structure, and working   fluid
properties, collectively influence vapor chamber performance. Recent studies emphasize   the   importance of   integrated design optimization for maximum efficiency (Ju   et   al., 2023).

compared to traditional heat sinks (Weibel  Garimella, 2021).
6.2 High-Performance   Computing
In high-performance computing (HPC) systems, thermal management is critical to            maintaining consistent computational performance. Vapor chambers have been successfully   integrated into servers and data centers to ensure uniform   temperature   distribution   across
